The application will change with changing need and demand 'cause as the product grows, we will add more features and code generation first we're going with stastical analysis , layouts and business application templates but with time we will add many more snippets like generating a deep learning architecture code just by describing the dataset and type of problem so with time we will build a complete tool which will cut the coding part of development more then 50 percent. As the current technological developemt is focused on web and deep learning development so we're gonna first focus on providing complete coding solution for these two and for this code generation of different type we're gonna use GPT3 which is the current advancement and best exisiting model in field of language processing trained on 175B parameters which uses Tranformers. So with changing tech and growth in filed of AI our application will keep getting better and better as it's based on AI, just like how language translation evolved with changing in tech and development in AI. We've seen the growth of language Translation which is most common and visible example which once used just the ENCODER-DECODER now uses ATTENTION and TRANSFORMER with which accuracy keeps getting better. So with change in Tech, Demand and Need our application will grow in extensive way with increase in performance capabilities.
